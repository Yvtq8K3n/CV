I'm passionate about science and technology, always looking for new challenges. I enjoy learning new technologies and adapting to different environments. I value collaboration and communication, and I try to support others when possible.\\
Outside of work, I like spending time with loved ones, watching movies, listening to music, cooking, meditating, and managing my self-hosted media server.\\
Iâ€™m currently seeking Senior Software Engineer roles, with a focus on distributed systems and scalable architectures.
